# Dropout-RegularizationSonar-Project-4-for-theNavy-Mines-vs.-Rocks
A simple and powerful regularization technique for neural networks and deep learning models is dropout. 
In this project I have use the dropout regularization technique and how to apply it to your models in Python with Keras.

In this project you will see:

•	How the dropout regularization technique works.

•	How to use dropout on your input layers.

•	How to use dropout on your hidden layers.

•	How to tune the dropout level on your problem.

## About Dataset

This is a dataset that describes sonar chirp returns bouncing off different services. The 60 input variables are the strength of the returns at different angles. It is a binary classification problem that requires a model to differentiate rocks from metal cylinders.

You can learn more about this dataset on the UCI Machine Learning repository:

We have downloaded the dataset for free and placed it in the project directory with the filename sonar.csv. You can also directly download the dataset:
